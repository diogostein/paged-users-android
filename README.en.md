# Paged Users App

App for listing users via remote API developed for the purpose of studies and focused on the use of the **Paging 3** library to implement paging.

The project was developed using the simple paging strategy from remote source only (webservice) and remote + local source (network + database) with `RemoteMediator`.

The implemented strategies were separated into 2 *branches*: `paging_source` and `remote_mediator`.

## Simple Paging

When paging directly from the network, the PagingSource loads the data and returns a LoadResult object. The PagingSource implementation is passed to the Pager through the pagingSourceFactory parameter.

As new data is required by the UI, the Pager calls the `load()` method from the PagingSource and returns a stream of PagingData objects that encapsulate the new data. Each PagingData object is typically cached in the ViewModel before being sent to the UI to display.

## Remote Mediator

A `RemoteMediator` implementation helps load paged data from the network into the database, but doesn't load data directly into the UI. Instead, the app uses the database as the ***source of truth***. In other words, the app only displays data that has been cached in the database. A `PagingSource` implementation (generated by `Room`) handles loading cached data from the database into the UI.
